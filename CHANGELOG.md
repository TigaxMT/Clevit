### 1.1.3

- The basic features of a Text Editor like New file , open , save , copy , cut , paste , undo , redo etc...
- A movable toolbar with some features mentioned above.
- TPad saves the files "smart" , like if you open a file , modify it and not save it, when you close he ask if you want save. But if you modify it, do not save it and in the end undo the modifications so when you leave it will not ask anything, because nothing is modified.
- Font comboBox ; Bold , Italic and Underline buttons
- The interface isn't very pretty, but will look better when adding more features

### 1.0.0

- First pre-release
